Analysis of Iterative Closest Point

This project evaluates several algorithms for iterative closest point. To compile and run this project, follow the instructions from linux_installation.txt.

We referenced and re-used some code from the exercises from the lecture "3D Scanning and Motion Capture" offered by the Computer Graphics and Visualization Group at the Technical University Munich in creating this project.
